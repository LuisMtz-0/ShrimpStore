# ShrimpStore

## Description

An E-comers store that allows the user to access many databases while linking them together. 
- By learning how to link models and access them with api routes will help me created more efficient website and pages that the user can access.
- By using models i can create and store data that will be used for my application as well as deleting any thing of my choosing. 
- A main problem i solve was retrieving the data had to json the res for it to render correctly. Had to retrieve the res.parm that were being inputted.
- This has helped me improve in creating data models that are linked to one another. Most importantly is to create api routes that use that data.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies needed to run the program. If needed clone the package.json file that contains them. 
2. Make sure that the database is running and that your connection.config has the correct data to access the database.
3. Run "Npm run watch"
4. Access insomnia to get the data and make sure to put the correct api routes
